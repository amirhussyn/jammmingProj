# jammmingProj

Codecademy - React Capstone Project

Pair-programmed by Precella Kwok (https://www.linkedin.com/in/precellakwok/) and myself

In this project, we built a React web application called Jammming. Knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API was applied to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

As fans of the renowned anime Naruto, we have personalised the application style around our favourite character of the series, Itachi Uchiha.
